"""Interface and shared infrastructure for initializers of the solver's initial guess

An initializer provides the cold initial guess, the concatenated array of [log_number_moles,
log_stability], from which the solver starts when no previous solution is available. It acts on a
single system and is vmapped over the batch by the solver, in the same way as
:func:`~atmodeller.solvers.solve_single`.

The solver decides which batch elements need a cold guess: rows of the initial guess passed to the
solver are used as given, and rows that contain ``NaN`` are replaced by the initializer's guess.
If no row contains ``NaN``, the initializer is not evaluated.

Concrete implementations are in :mod:`atmodeller.initializer.heuristic` and
:mod:`atmodeller.initializer.element_potential`. This module also holds what they share: the trace
value for species with a negligible element budget, and the moles of species limited by the
element budget.
